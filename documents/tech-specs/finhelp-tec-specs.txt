Key API & Logic FlowsSMS Parsing (finance-logic.js): The parseSms function will use an array of regular expressions to identify transaction details from major South African banks. It will return an array of structured transaction objects.Net Wealth Calculation (Cloud Function): A nightly-run Firebase Cloud Function (calculateNetWealth) will be triggered to read all documents in a user's assets and liabilities collections, calculate the total, and update the netWealth field in their financial_profile. This prevents slow, client-side calculations.Public Report Generation (publisher.js): When a user creates a public financial report, a new document is created in a top-level /public_reports/{reportId} collection. This document stores which data points are shared and has an expiry date. The public page will read from this document, not directly from the user's private data.
